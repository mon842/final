# Next.js Todo App with Authentication and CRUD Features

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nextjs-todo-app.git
cd nextjs-todo-app
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality.
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Real-time Updates:** Automatic page updates as you edit files.
- **Font Optimization:** Automatic optimization and loading of Google Fonts.

## Authentication

This app includes basic authentication features using NextAuth.js. To get started, configure your authentication providers and set up the necessary environment variables.

## CRUD Operations

The todo app allows users to perform CRUD operations on their tasks. Users can add new tasks, view a list of tasks, update task details, and delete tasks they no longer need.
